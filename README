WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

  A code generator for highly optimized databases.


DESCRIPTION:

The achievement of top database efficiency demands the use of C++ to
optimize space requirements and access times of perl data.
Unfortunately, once we step down from perl to C++ things get
complicated.

Suddenly, each database brings with it the baggage of an application
specific schema and the corresponding C++ support code.  Even worse,
as new versions are developed all the schemas and code from prior
versions must continue to be supported or old data will become much
less convenient to access.  Another alternative, schema evolution, is
an enormous amount of trouble and should be possible to avoid or at
least easy to postpone.  The new dump and load facility introduced
with OS 5.1 is a help, but it doesn't squarely address the same
problem.

We need to balance two opposing desires:

1. Optimize data using customized C++ objects.

2. Try to minimize the bulk of schema and object code needed for
ongoing backward compatibility.


IMPLEMENTATION:

Just like a relational database.  Records are encoded by field offset
and type, with all the manipulation being generic.
